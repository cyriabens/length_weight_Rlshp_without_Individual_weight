### This work shows an example of how to calculate a size/weight curve for a sample of fish in the absence of individual weights. 
The MEDITS protocol includes systematic measurements of individual size for the 22 selected species, but few of them are individually weighed. In the absence of individual weights 
for each species and in each haul sample, the data available consists of a total biomass and an associated size spectrum.
